## Description

Literature course in Bioinformatics for Biologists at
[NRM](https://www.nrm.se/) given in the fall 2020.

The course follows the text book *Computing Skills for Biologists - A Toolbox*,
by Allesina & Wilmes (Princeton University Press, 2019).

Accompanying web page from the publisher is here:
[https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB](https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB).

A fork of the CSB repository is also present in this repository as a submodule.
This submodule (folder) is tracking
<https://github.com/Naturhistoriska/CSB.git>. Expect some changes between this
local copy and the original [CSB repository](https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB).

To clone the BIOinfo-course repository, including the CSB submodule, use this
command:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Naturhistoriska/BIOinfo-course.git

Note, all occasions (except the first: "Introduction") will be follow-up
sessions where we will share problems, solutions, and experiences from
participants after solving exercises in the mentioned chapters. For some dates
(indicated in **bold**), there are two weeks in between the meetings.

## Presentation material (slides)

Presentation material (jupyter notebooks, `.ipynb`) and slides (`.html`) are
available in the [slides](slides) folder. Clone the BIOinfo-course repository
and open the files locally (in jupyter or web browser) for best experience.

## More detailed information

### What:

The course will consist of a series of meetings (physical and/or online) where
we will go through the chapters in a recent text book in bioinformatics:
"Computational Skills for Biologists - A Toolbox" by Stefano Allesina and
Madlen Wilmes (Princeton University Press, 2019).

Participants are expected to get a copy of the book on their own.

Students are expected to solve the exercises in the book between each occasion,
where we will discuss solutions, issues, and more.

### Learning outcomes:

Upon completion of the course, the participant will have training and good
knowledge in important bioinformatic topics such as

- Working in a Unix/Linux environment
- Use version control (git)
- The Python programming language
- Scientific typesetting (LaTeX)
- The R programming language
- Relational databases (SQLite)

### Who:

The course is aiming for some students at NRM, but anyone interested can join.

No prior knowledge in bioinformatics is needed, but participants will need a
computer with suitable tools installed (help with that will be provided), in
order to follow the course.

### When:

We are aiming for a start during week 40 (one of the days Tue-Fri), and the
ambition is to meet once a week (or every second week - partly up to the
participants).  The number of occasions is somewhat dependent on the pace of
the students, but the book have 11 chapters...

### Where:

We will meet at NRM (room number decided later), with the possibility to join
on line.

### How to apply:

Send me an e-mail (emailto:Johan.Nylander) before September 26 (2020).
